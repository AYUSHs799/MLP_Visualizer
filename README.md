An Application that can be used to visualize the predictions of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regressor by vaying various aspect of the model.

Below are the various parameters that can be varied to see the effect on the predictions of the model.

* Number of hidden Layers.
* Number of Neurons in each layer.
* Activation Function.
* Learning Rate.
* Optimizer.
* Number of iterations.
* Noise in the data.
* Test-Train Split.

The application outputs the following:
* The predictions of the model.
* Errors in the predictions.
* Training and Testing Datasets.
